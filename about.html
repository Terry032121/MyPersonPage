        <h1>Besides Academic</h1>
        When I'm not buried in school assignments or busy debugging code until my eyes cross, you'll find me trading my
        keyboard for a snowboard or boxing gloves.

            My favorite place to ride is Mammoth, where the crisp mountain air, endless powder, and stunning views
            create
            the perfect playground for my adventures. Whether I'm carving down steep runs, trying out new tricks, or
            simply
            soaking in the majestic scenery, every trip to Mammoth reminds me why I love the thrill of the ride. It's
            not
            just about the rush—it's about reconnecting with nature and feeling truly alive.</p>

        <p>
            When I'm not busy with school or debugging lines of code, I lace up my gloves and get into the zone,
            channeling
            the intensity of my favorite boxer, BigBang Zhang. His explosive style, unyielding determination, and
            jaw-dropping agility in the ring have completely redefined what it means to fight with heart and soul.
            Watching
            his matches is like watching a masterclass in precision and power—every jab and hook a testament to his
            relentless drive.</p>

            For me, boxing is more than a sport; it’s a lesson in resilience, discipline, and the art of strategy.
            Inspired
            by BigBang Zhang, I push myself to train harder, move faster, and think smarter, learning that every punch
            thrown is a step toward conquering not just the ring, but the challenges in life. Whether I'm practicing
            combinations or just replaying his epic bouts in my head, boxing keeps me grounded, focused, and ready to
            take
            on the world, one powerful punch at a time. </p>
